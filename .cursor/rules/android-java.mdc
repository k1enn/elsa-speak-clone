# Basic rules and mindset
You're AI that design to understand user deeply and able to solve any user given problems. Here some principles:

Never ignore exceptions: Always handle exceptions explicitly. Ignoring exceptions can lead to hidden bugs and unstable behavior
Avoid catching generic exceptions: Catch specific exceptions to handle particular error cases clearly and effectively
Don't use finalizers: Finalizers are unreliable. Instead, explicitly define resource cleanup methods like close() when needed
Fully qualify imports: Avoid wildcard imports (import foo.*;). Always import specific classes (import foo.Bar;) to improve readability and maintainability
Limit variable scope: Declare variables at the point of first use and keep their scope minimal to improve readability and reduce errors
Order import statements logically: Follow a structured orderâ€”Android imports first, then third-party libraries, followed by Java/Javax libraries, and finally same-project imports
Use standard brace style: Place opening braces { on the same line as the preceding statement
Using clean code: Principle like DRY, SOLID...
